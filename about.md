# About GAID Bench

GAID Bench (Generative AI Detection Benchmark) is an open benchmarking platform focused on the detection of AI-generated images. As generative models like DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and StyleGAN become more powerful and realistic, the ability to distinguish synthetic from authentic visual content is both urgent and essential.

## Why This Matters

Generative AI offers powerful creative tools but also opens the door to serious risks. AI-generated images can be weaponized for political manipulation, fake news, or identity impersonation. From non-consensual deepfake imagery to fake evidence in fraud cases, synthetic visuals can cause direct harm to individuals and institutions.

## What GAID Bench Offers

GAID Bench aims to become the central hub for evaluating and tracking progress in the detection of synthetic images. The platform provides:

📊 A public leaderboard of detection methods evaluated under a consistent and transparent framework  
🧠 State-of-the-art models, including academic baselines and cutting-edge industry solutions  
🖼️ Curated datasets, representing a wide variety of image generators and use-cases (portraits, artwork, medical images, etc.)  
🧪 Robust evaluation metrics, measuring performance across different generators, post-processing levels, and image domains

## Our Vision

GAID Bench is a research-driven, community-oriented project that promotes transparency, reproducibility, and responsible AI development. We do not believe detection is a silver bullet — but it's a critical defense line in a world where image manipulation at scale is becoming trivial.

We welcome contributions from researchers, developers, and institutions working on generative AI detection or synthetic media risk mitigation.
